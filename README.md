A small inconspicuous case for a ESP8266 NodeMCU Development Board v2.

Could be used in conjuction with a TTL IR transceiver-head to read Smart-Meters.

For the IR transceiver head you could [build your own](https://wiki.volkszaehler.org/hardware/controllers/ir-schreib-lesekopf-ttl-ausgang) or just buy a cheap one from eBay, Amazon, etc. (search for "TTL IR Lesekopf").

If you're a customer of Wiener Netze, you can use this [firmware](https://github.com/aldadic/esp-smartmeter-reader) to read the customer interface and
directly transmit the data to a MQTT broker and for example to Home Assistant.
